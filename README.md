# CI2024_lab2
Second laboratory for the Computational Intelligence course at PoliTO, about Evolutionary Algorithms applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem.  

The implementations of non evolutionary solutions to the problem can be found in `tsp_greedy_and_recursive.ipynb`. These implementations already have decent if not good performance.  
Description of the processes can be found at the beginning of each paragraph, and a findings sum up, with graphical aid, at the bottom of the notebook.

In `tsp_mutations.ipynb` you can find implemenation of evolutionary algorithms. This file is much longer than the previous one, but the main logic can be inferred from the helper functions, the rest is just running different instances.  
Again, for each paragraph there may be some description of what I did in the following cells, and at the complete bottom of the notebook, there is a sum up of the findings, aided by a scatter plot.
